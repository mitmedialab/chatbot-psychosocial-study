# SocialClassifiers

In the literature, prosocial behaviors are defined as "acts that are [...] generally beneficial to other people", such as showing empathy or validating another’s feeling; we contrast these with socially improper behaviors that are disadvantageous to other people. We built an extended set of classifiers as an extension to those introduced in [Phang2025] to target specific prosocial and socially improper behaviors. Each chatbot message was classified along 18 distinct dimensions of prosocial and socially improper behaviors, such as "empathetic responses", "reminding of emotional self‐care", "suggesting social activity with other people", "failing to offer support", and "advising against seeking professional help".
